This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```r
## summary(cars)
echo = TRUE
df<-read.csv("activity", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

```
## Warning in file(file, "rt"): cannot open file 'activity': No such file or
## directory
```

```
## Error in file(file, "rt"): cannot open the connection
```
